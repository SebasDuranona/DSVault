# Sorting Algorithm Comparison (Under Construction)

This Python program allows users to compare two sorting algorithms by providing a set of elements to be sorted and selecting two algorithms for comparison. The program provides step-by-step comparisons for each algorithm and reports the execution time in nanoseconds to determine which algorithm performs better.

**Disclaimer:** Comparing sorting algorithms in nanoseconds can be challenging and may not always provide the most meaningful results. Factors such as hardware, input size, and the specific data set can influence the timing results.
