# Sorting Algorithm Comparison (Under Construction)

This Python program allows users to compare two sorting algorithms by providing a set of elements to be sorted and selecting two algorithms for comparison. The program provides step-by-step comparisons for each algorithm and reports the execution time in nanoseconds to determine which algorithm performs better.

**Disclaimer:** Comparing sorting algorithms in nanoseconds can be challenging and may not always provide the most meaningful results. Factors such as hardware, input size, and the specific data set can influence the timing results.

## Audience

SortShowcase is designed for:

- **Students**: Ideal for computer science students who want to get an overview of different sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Compare the performance of two sorting algorithms.
- Visualize the step-by-step sorting process.
- Measure execution time in nanoseconds for accurate performance comparison.
- Input your own dataset or use predefined examples.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the program using Python 3.x.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the elements to be sorted and select the algorithms for comparison.
4. The program will display step-by-step comparisons for each algorithm.
5. At the end of the comparison, it will report the execution time in nanoseconds for each algorithm.
