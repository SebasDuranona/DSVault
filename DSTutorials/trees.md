# Trees
Trees are fundamental data structures in computer science, and their hierarchical nature is the basis of the implementation of some of the most important computer science concepts. In this article, we will explore binary trees, binary search trees (BSTs), and balanced trees. We will also dive into two essential tree traversal algorithms: depth-first and breadth-first.

## Binary Trees
A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes, each of which has, at most, two child nodes - typically referred to as the left and right children. The topmost node, known as the root, serves as the starting point for traversing the tree. Binary trees can be used to represent hierarchical structures like file systems and family trees.
## Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
A Binary Search Tree is a special kind of binary tree. In a BST, nodes are organized in such a way that for each node:
- All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node.
- All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node.

This property makes BSTs efficient for searching, insertion, and deletion operations, with average time complexities of O(log n).

## Balanced Trees
Balanced trees, such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees, are designed to maintain a balance between the left and right subtrees. Balancing ensures that the tree height remains logarithmic, preventing worst-case scenarios where the tree becomes degenerate. This property guarantees that search, insert, and delete operations have time complexities of O(log n).
