# Linked Lists
Linked lists are linear data structures consisting of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are highly versatile and come in several forms, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. In this article, we will explore these variations and get an overview of how they are implemented in Python.
## Singly Linked Lists
A singly linked list is the most basic type of linked list. Each node in a singly linked list contains two components: data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node.
### Implementation in Python:
```
class Node:
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data
    self.next = None

class SinglyLinkedList:
  def __init__(self):
    self.head = None
```
**Overview:**
- First, you create a linked list by instantiating a ***'SinglyLinkedList'*** object.
- Then, you add elements to it by creating ***'Node'*** objects and linking them together using the **'next'** pointers.

## Doubly Linked Lists
A doubly linked list extends the singly linked list by adding a reference to the previous node in each node. This bidirectional linkage makes it easier to traverse the list in both directions.
### Implementation in Python:
```
class Node:
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data
    self.next = None
    self.prev = None

class DoublyLinkedList:
  def __init__(self):
    self.head = None
```
**Overview:**
- Just like with singly linked lists, you create a ***'DoublyLinkedList'*** object and add elements to it by creating ***'Node'*** objects.
- In addition to the **'next'** pointer linking each element to the next, you link each element to the previous one using the **'prev'** pointer.

## Circular Linked Lists
In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop. This structure is useful in situations where you need continuous access to elements.
### Implementation in Python
```
class Node:
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data
    self.next = None

class CircularLinkedList:
  def __init__(self):
    self.head = None
```
**Overview:**
- A circular linked list is implemented in the same way as a singly linked list object, but the ***last*** node's **'next'** pointer needs to be connected to the head.

## Common Operations

Linked lists support common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. Here's a brief overview:

- **Insertion:** To insert an element, update the `next` pointers of the surrounding nodes accordingly.

- **Deletion:** To delete a node, change the `next` and `prev` pointers of the neighboring nodes (in the case of doubly linked lists).

- **Traversal:** To traverse a linked list, start at the head and follow the `next` or `prev` pointers until you reach the desired node.

Linked lists are used in various applications, such as managing memory, implementing data structures like stacks and queues, and in scenarios where dynamic size and efficient insertions/deletions are essential.

By mastering the concepts and implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists in Python, you'll expand your toolkit for data structure manipulation and become better equipped to tackle a wide range of programming challenges.
